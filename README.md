Elvis Esakho Ayilo

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Jomo Kenyatta University, fueled by a passion for crafting intuitive, user-focused web applications and exploring the limitless potential of artificial intelligence. With expertise in front-end development using React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Tailwind CSS, I‚Äôve built dynamic projects. My work blends technical precision with a creative spark, delivering responsive, engaging interfaces that solve real-world problems.

As a self-taught AI enthusiast, I‚Äôm captivated by AI agents and their ability to transform industries. My coursework in machine learning, combined with hands-on experience in data structures, algorithms, and Python, has deepened my curiosity for building intelligent systems. With over two years as a freelance copywriter, I bring a unique storytelling flair to my code, creating user experiences that are both functional and captivating. Fluent in Swahili and English, I thrive in connecting with diverse audiences and collaborating on innovative projects.

When I‚Äôm not coding or diving into AI research, you‚Äôll find me vibing to new ideas, experimenting with personal projects, or sharing knowledge as a Swahili tutor. Check out my repositories to see my latest work, from web apps to AI-driven experiments. Let‚Äôs build something extraordinary together!
